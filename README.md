# Snake-Game üêç
Snake-Game via Python

This Python project utilizes the Pygame library to develop a Snake game. It structures the game logic into three classes: SNAKE, FRUIT, and MAIN.
The SNAKE class manages the snake's behavior, including movement, rendering, and collision detection. The FRUIT class handles the fruit's position, rendering, and randomization.
The MAIN class acts as the central controller, orchestrating game state updates, drawing elements on the screen, and managing user input.

The main game loop continuously executes, responding to user input events and updating the game state accordingly.
It checks for collisions between the snake, fruit, and game boundaries to determine score changes and game over conditions.
The code incorporates image and sound loading for visual and auditory feedback during gameplay.

Implemented concepts such as Object-oriented programming principles, Modules and Packages, Image and sound loading, Conditional statements, Looping, File I/O,
Data Structures and Manipulation, Error handling, Event-Driven Programming
